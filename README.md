# javascript-challenge

This is javascript first homework. I did not attempt level 2 this week in the interest of time.

The code is largely pulled from class activities.

After defining tbody, a for loop builds the table from the javascript data. 

Then functions give functionality to the button and input on the page so that the data is filtered by date and the table is cleared and then recreated via a for loop.
